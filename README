This is a form validator that uses CodeIgniter rule strings to do the form
validation. It is suppose to lower the number of server calls by validating
forms on the client side before submitting the data to the server.

**********
IMPORTANT:
	This should not replace the CodeIgniter php form validation! Remember
	JavaScript is easily manipulated, so by removing the php validation you put
	your CI application at risk. So use this form validator along with CI form
	validator.
**********

Still a work in progress...
TODO:
	* add the rest of the CI rules (is_unique, valid_emails, xss_clean, prep_for_form, prep_url, strip_image_tags)
	* separate prepping functions
	* move rule tests to separate functions [DONE]
	* implement a callback function [DONE]
